# Anmeldung

In Germany, you must register your address at the Bürgeramt. 
This will become your official address in Germany. This is called the Anmeldung. Same as Propiska in Russian.

During the Anmeldung appointment, you get a registration certificate (Anmeldebestätigung). This document confirms your official address in Germany. You often need it to open a bank account or get a cellphone contract. 
After your first Anmeldung, you will also get a [tax ID](finanzamt.md) (Steueridentifikationsnummer).

- Once you have your temporary address start to book the termin (aka apppointment slot) to get an Anmeldung.
